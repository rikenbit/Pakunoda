# Pakunoda

**Factorization problem compiler and reproducible workflow for heterogeneous matrix/tensor data.**

Pakunoda takes a collection of heterogeneous matrices and tensors with shared or related modes,
constructs coupled/joint decomposition problems from a declarative configuration,
runs them through [mwTensor](https://github.com/rikenbit/mwTensor), and produces a ranked summary.

## What Pakunoda is

- A **config-first workflow** that turns `config.yaml` + data files into validated, scored decomposition results
- A **problem compiler** that builds the relation graph, enumerates candidates, and generates solver-ready structures
- A **reproducible pipeline** built on Snakemake with container support

## What Pakunoda is NOT

- **Not a solver library.** The actual decomposition is performed by `mwTensor`. Pakunoda constructs the problem; `mwTensor` solves it.
- **Not a visualization tool.** Report generation is planned but not yet implemented.
- **Not a full AutoML system.** Optuna-based MVP search (rank, init policy) is implemented, but advanced features — multi-objective optimization, richer recommendation, and automated model selection — are not yet available.

## Responsibility split

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Read data, validate config, build relation graph | **Pakunoda** |
| Enumerate decomposition candidates | **Pakunoda** |
| Execute candidates via solver | **Pakunoda** (calls mwTensor) |
| Score and rank results | **Pakunoda** |
| Solve a single defined decomposition problem | **mwTensor** |
| Hyperparameter search (Optuna) | **Pakunoda** |
| Report generation | **Pakunoda** (future) |

## Current scope and limitations (v0.1.0)

**What works:**
- Relations: `exact` and `nested`
- Solver family: `CoupledMWCA` only
- Scoring: reconstruction error, runtime, total model complexity
- Search: Optuna-based imputation search over rank and init policy
- File formats: `.tsv`, `.csv`, `.mat` (MATLAB v5/v7), `.tns` (FROSTT coordinate)

**Mock / stub areas:**
- **Mock solver.** When `search.mock: true` (or R/mwTensor is unavailable), execution uses a Python SVD-based approximation instead of mwTensor. The mock solver only handles 2D matrices; higher-order tensors are returned as-is. Use `config_mock.yaml` for mock mode, `config.yaml` for real solver.
- **Nested relation preprocessing.** Many-to-one nested relations (e.g., genes → pathways) are supported via aggregation: Pakunoda reads the mapping file, computes group-mean aggregation of the source block, and replaces the nested relation with an exact relation on the aggregated block. Limitations: only 2D matrices, only many-to-one direction, only mean aggregation. One-to-many expansion and weighted aggregation are not yet supported.
- **Recommendation heuristics.** `best_by_balanced_score` uses fixed weights (0.7 error, 0.3 complexity) with min-max normalization. This is a simple heuristic, not a principled selection criterion.

**Not yet implemented:**
- Papermill report generation
- MCP / AI agent interface
- Multi-objective Pareto search
- Block-wise or relation-aware masking (only elementwise random)
- Stability metrics (cross-validation, bootstrap)
- One-to-many nested expansion, weighted aggregation
- Additional solver families beyond CoupledMWCA

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.7, NumPy, SciPy, Snakemake, Optuna, PyYAML
- For real solver: R >= 4.1, [mwTensor](https://github.com/rikenbit/mwTensor)
- Or use Docker (all dependencies included)
- Or use mock mode (`search.mock: true`) to run without R

### Run with real solver (Docker, recommended)

The Docker image includes R, mwTensor, and all dependencies.

```bash
docker build -t pakunoda .

# Real mwTensor solver (default config)
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/examples/toy_heterogeneous:/work pakunoda \
  --snakefile /app/Snakefile --configfile /work/config.yaml --cores 1
```

### Run with mock solver (no Docker/R required)

```bash
snakemake --snakefile Snakefile \
  --configfile examples/toy_heterogeneous/config_mock.yaml --cores 1
```

### GHCR image

Pre-built image (after CI setup):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/rikenbit/pakunoda:latest
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/examples/toy_heterogeneous:/work ghcr.io/rikenbit/pakunoda:latest \
  --snakefile /app/Snakefile --configfile /work/config.yaml --cores 1
```

## Configuration

Pakunoda is driven entirely by `config.yaml`. See [docs/config-reference.md](docs/config-reference.md) for the full specification.

Minimal example:

```yaml
project:
  id: my_analysis

blocks:
  - id: expression
    file: data/expression.tsv
    kind: matrix
    modes: [samples, genes]
  - id: methylation
    file: data/methylation.tsv
    kind: matrix
    modes: [samples, cpg_sites]

relations:
  - type: exact
    between:
      - { block: expression, mode: samples }
      - { block: methylation, mode: samples }

solver:
  family: CoupledMWCA

search:
  max_rank: 5
  mock: true
  enabled: true
  goal: imputation
  max_trials: 20
  seed: 42
  rank_range: [2, 5]
  init_policies: [random, svd]
  masking:
    scheme: elementwise
    fraction: 0.1
```

## Pipeline stages

| Stage | Rule | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ingest` | Detect file formats, read dimensions, produce metadata JSON |
| 2 | `canonicalize` | Convert all inputs to a common internal format (NumPy `.npy`) |
| 3 | `preprocess_nested` | Aggregate source blocks for nested relations (if any) |
| 4 | `validate` | Check config consistency, dimensional compatibility, relation validity |
| 5 | `graph` | Build the block-mode relation graph |
| 6 | `enumerate` | Constrained enumeration of valid decomposition candidates |
| 7 | `compile_candidates` | Compile each candidate into a mwTensor problem JSON |
| 8 | `run_candidates` | Execute each candidate via mwTensor (or mock solver) |
| 9 | `score_candidates` | Score each result: reconstruction error, runtime, complexity |
| 10 | `summarize` | Aggregate scores into ranked summary JSON and TSV |
| 11 | `prepare_search` | Create masks and search spaces (when `search.enabled: true`) |
| 12 | `run_search` | Run Optuna trials for each candidate |
| 13 | `summarize_search` | Produce trials table, best JSON, summary TSV |
| 14 | `recommend` | Generate recommendation report with best picks and explanations |
